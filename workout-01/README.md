  For our project workout-01, we are analyzing NBA data from the Golden State Warriors in order to create visual shot charts as well as tables for the effective field goal percentages of the players through our data analysis stage. Using this, we can analyze the offensive profiles of each of the selected players and write a report highlighting various statistics which compare/contrast the effectiveness of each of the players. The data for the players was gathered from a remote GitHub repository. The purpose of this project, in practical sense for the Stat 133 class, is to learn how to work with a Version control system (Git) in order to manage our files/folders, manipulate data so that we can analyze and create visuals, and report the information we obtain from analysis. These clearly represent the stages of Data cycle as we are preparing our data, analyzing it and then reporting our findings.
