A famous quote by [General Grievous](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grievous):

> *I'm no errand boy. And I'm not in this war for Dooku's politics. I am the leader of the most powerful droid army the galaxy has ever seen!*

[**Sweet Potato Taco Recipe**](https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/03/sweet-potato-tacos/)

-   Ingredients
    -   2 pounds (about 4 medium) sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2 to 3/4â³ cubes
    -   Olive oil
    -   1 heaped teaspoon kosher salt
    -   1 heaped teaspoon ground cumin
    -   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    -   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
    -   1 to 3 teaspoons chili powder, to taste (see Note)
    -   Chipotle powder, cayenne, or shakes of hot sauce, to taste (see Note)
    -   1/2 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika
    -   12 six-inch or 6 eight to nine-inch flour tortillas
    -   1 fifteen-ounce can refried black beans
    -   1 lime, in wedges
    -   Sliced avocado, pickled red onions, pickled jalapenos, chopped fresh cilantro, hot sauce, Lazy Taco Slaw, or your choice(s) thereof, to finish
-   Special Kitchen Tools
    -   No special kitchen tools need (just an oven, stove and cooking trays/pans)
-   Recipe Steps
    1.  Heat Oven to 400**<sup>∘</sup> F
    2.  Toss sweet potatoes with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then add salt, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, chipotle powder, and paprika and toss to evenly coat
    3.  Roast potatoes for 40 to 45 minutes, tossing once or twice for even color
    4.  Char tortillas on gas stove top
    5.  Schmear refriend beans, add 1 to 2 large spoonfuls of roasted sweet potato, squeeze lime juice over potatoes and black beans, and finish with adding toppings of your choice
-   Special Seasons for this Dish?
    -   Nope, this dish can be made all year round
-   Variations
    -   If youâd like to roast the vegetables (for easier cleanup) on parchment paper, line a large baking sheet with it and spread the potatoes in a single layer. If youâd like to roast them directly on your baking sheet for extra crispiness, first coat it with 1 more tablespoon of olive oil, then spread potatoes in an even layer.
    -   If you don't have a gas stove, you can wrap the stack of tortillas in foil and let them warm in the oven while the potatoes roast for 5 minutes
    -   Dish can be completed with any toppings of your choice

### Euclidian Distance

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if *p* = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and *q* = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$\\textit{d} 
   \\textbf{(p,q)} 
   = \\textit{d} 
   \\textbf{(q,p)} 
   = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$$

$$=\\sqrt
{\\sum\_{i=1} ^ {n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\left\\lVert
\\textbf{p} 
\\right\\rVert
= \\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2} 
= \\sqrt{\\textbf{p}\\cdot\\textbf{p}}$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
